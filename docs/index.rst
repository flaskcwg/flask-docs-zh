Welcome to Flask's documentation. Get started with :doc:`installation`
and then get an overview with the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a
more detailed :doc:`tutorial/index` that shows how to create a small but
complete application with Flask. Common patterns are described in the
:doc:`patterns/index` section. The rest of the docs describe each
component of Flask in detail, with a full reference in the :doc:`api`
section.

Flask depends on the `Jinja`_ template engine and the `Werkzeug`_ WSGI
toolkit. The documentation for these libraries can be found at:

- `Jinja documentation <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/>`_
- `Werkzeug documentation <https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/>`_
