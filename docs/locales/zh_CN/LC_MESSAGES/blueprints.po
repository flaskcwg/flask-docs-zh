"Flask uses a concept of *blueprints* for making application components "
"and supporting common patterns within an application or across "
"applications. Blueprints can greatly simplify how large applications work"
" and provide a central means for Flask extensions to register operations "
"on applications. A :class:`Blueprint` object works similarly to a "
":class:`Flask` application object, but it is not actually an application."
"  Rather it is a *blueprint* of how to construct or extend an "
"application."

"A blueprint in Flask is not a pluggable app because it is not actually an"
" application -- it's a set of operations which can be registered on an "
"application, even multiple times.  Why not have multiple application "
"objects?  You can do that (see :doc:`/patterns/appdispatch`), but your "
"applications will have separate configs and will be managed at the WSGI "
"layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:42

"Blueprints instead provide separation at the Flask level, share "

msgid "The Concept of Blueprints"
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:51
msgid ""
"The basic concept of blueprints is that they record operations to execute"

"endpoint to another."

"This is what a very basic blueprint looks like.  In this case we want to "
"implement a blueprint that does simple rendering of static templates::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:76
msgid ""
"When you bind a function with the help of the ``@simple_page.route`` "
"decorator, the blueprint will record the intention of registering the "
"function ``show`` on the application when it's later registered. "
"Additionally it will prefix the endpoint of the function with the name of"
" the blueprint which was given to the :class:`Blueprint` constructor (in "
"this case also ``simple_page``). The blueprint's name does not modify the"
" URL, only the endpoint."

#: ../../blueprints.rst:103

"The first one is obviously from the application itself for the static "
"files.  The other two are for the `show` function of the ``simple_page`` "

"blueprint and separated by a dot (``.``)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:161
msgid ""
"The folder is inferred from the second argument to :class:`Blueprint` "

" module or package corresponds to the blueprint.  If it points to an "
"actual Python package that package (which is a folder on the filesystem) "
"is the resource folder.  If it's a module, the package the module is "
"contained in will be the resource folder.  You can access the "
":attr:`Blueprint.root_path` property to see what the resource folder is::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:172
msgid ""

msgid "Static Files"
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:181

"A blueprint can expose a folder with static files by providing the path "
"to the folder on the filesystem with the ``static_folder`` argument. It "
"is either an absolute path or relative to the blueprint's location::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:187
msgid ""
"By default the rightmost part of the path is where it is exposed on the "
"web. This can be changed with the ``static_url_path`` argument. Because "
"the folder is called ``static`` here it will be available at the "
"``url_prefix`` of the blueprint + ``/static``. If the blueprint has the "
"prefix ``/admin``, the static URL will be ``/admin/static``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:199
msgid ""
"However, if the blueprint does not have a ``url_prefix``, it is not "
"possible to access the blueprint's static folder. This is because the URL"
" would be ``/static`` in this case, and the application's ``/static`` "
"route takes precedence. Unlike template folders, blueprint static folders"
" are not searched if the file does not exist in the application static "
"folder."

msgid ""
"For static files, the path can be absolute or relative to the blueprint "

#: ../../blueprints.rst:217
msgid ""
"The template folder is added to the search path of templates but with a "
"lower priority than the actual application's template folder. That way "
"you can easily override templates that a blueprint provides in the actual"
" application. This also means that if you don't want a blueprint template"
" to be accidentally overridden, make sure that no other blueprint or "
"actual application template has the same relative path. When multiple "
"blueprints provide the same relative template path the first blueprint "
"registered takes precedence over the others."
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:226
msgid ""
"So if you have a blueprint in the folder ``yourapplication/admin`` and "
"you want to render the template ``'admin/index.html'`` and you have "
"provided ``templates`` as a `template_folder` you will have to create a "
"file like this: :file:`yourapplication/admin/templates/admin/index.html`."
" The reason for the extra ``admin`` folder is to avoid getting our "
"template overridden by a template named ``index.html`` in the actual "
"application template folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:234
msgid ""
"To further reiterate this: if you have a blueprint named ``admin`` and "
"you want to render a template called :file:`index.html` which is specific"
" to this blueprint, the best idea is to lay out your templates like "
"this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:246
msgid ""
"And then when you want to render the template, use "
":file:`admin/index.html` as the name to look up the template by.  If you "
"encounter problems loading the correct templates enable the "
"``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config variable which will instruct Flask to"
" print out the steps it goes through to locate templates on every "
"``render_template`` call."

"(``.``)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../blueprints.rst:261
msgid ""
"Additionally if you are in a view function of a blueprint or a rendered "

"Most errorhandlers will simply work as expected; however, there is a "
"caveat concerning handlers for 404 and 405 exceptions.  These "
"errorhandlers are only invoked from an appropriate ``raise`` statement or"
" a call to ``abort`` in another of the blueprint's view functions; they "
"are not invoked by, e.g., an invalid URL access.  This is because the "
"blueprint does not \"own\" a certain URL space, so the application "
"instance has no way of knowing which blueprint error handler it should "
"run if given an invalid URL.  If you would like to execute different "
"handling strategies for these errors based on URL prefixes, they may be "
"defined at the application level using the ``request`` proxy object::"
