"The Flask documentation and example applications are using HTML5.  You "
"may notice that in many situations, when end tags are optional they are "
"not used, so that the HTML is cleaner and faster to load.  Because there "
"is much confusion about HTML and XHTML among developers, this document "
"tries to answer some of the major questions."

"For a while, it appeared that HTML was about to be replaced by XHTML. "
"However, barely any websites on the Internet are actual XHTML (which is "
"HTML processed using XML rules).  There are a couple of major reasons why"
" this is the case.  One of them is Internet Explorer's lack of proper "
"XHTML support. The XHTML spec states that XHTML must be served with the "
"MIME type :mimetype:`application/xhtml+xml`, but Internet Explorer "
"refuses to read files with that MIME type. While it is relatively easy to"
" configure Web servers to serve XHTML properly, few people do.  This is "
"likely because properly using XHTML can be quite painful."
msgstr ""

#: ../../htmlfaq.rst:25
msgid ""
"One of the most important causes of pain is XML's draconian (strict and "
"ruthless) error handling.  When an XML parsing error is encountered, the "
"browser is supposed to show the user an ugly error message, instead of "
"attempting to recover from the error and display what it can.  Most of "
"the (X)HTML generation on the web is based on non-XML template engines "
"(such as Jinja, the one used in Flask) which do not protect you from "
"accidentally creating invalid XHTML.  There are XML based template "
"engines, such as Kid and the popular Genshi, but they often come with a "
"larger runtime overhead and are not as straightforward to use because "
"they have to obey XML rules."
msgstr ""

#: ../../htmlfaq.rst:36
msgid ""
"The majority of users, however, assumed they were properly using XHTML. "
"They wrote an XHTML doctype at the top of the document and self-closed "
"all the necessary tags (``<br>`` becomes ``<br/>`` or ``<br></br>`` in "
"XHTML). However, even if the document properly validates as XHTML, what "
"really determines XHTML/HTML processing in browsers is the MIME type, "
"which as said before is often not set properly. So the valid XHTML was "
"being treated as invalid HTML."
msgstr ""

#: ../../htmlfaq.rst:44
msgid ""
"XHTML also changed the way JavaScript is used. To properly work with "
"XHTML, programmers have to use the namespaced DOM interface with the "
"XHTML namespace to query for HTML elements."

msgid "History of HTML5"

#: ../../htmlfaq.rst:51
msgid ""
"Development of the HTML5 specification was started in 2004 under the name"
" \"Web Applications 1.0\" by the Web Hypertext Application Technology "
"Working Group, or WHATWG (which was formed by the major browser vendors "
"Apple, Mozilla, and Opera) with the goal of writing a new and improved "
"HTML specification, based on existing browser behavior instead of "
"unrealistic and backwards-incompatible specifications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../htmlfaq.rst:58
msgid ""
"For example, in HTML4 ``<title/Hello/`` theoretically parses exactly the "
"same as ``<title>Hello</title>``.  However, since people were using "
"XHTML-like tags along the lines of ``<link />``, browser vendors "
"implemented the XHTML syntax over the syntax defined by the "
"specification."
msgstr ""

#: ../../htmlfaq.rst:63
msgid ""
"In 2007, the specification was adopted as the basis of a new HTML "
"specification under the umbrella of the W3C, known as HTML5.  Currently, "
"it appears that XHTML is losing traction, as the XHTML 2 working group "
"has been disbanded and HTML5 is being implemented by all major browser "
"vendors."
