"Starting with Flask 0.6, there is integrated support for signalling in "
"Flask.  This support is provided by the excellent `blinker`_ library and "
"will gracefully fall back if it is not available."

"What are signals?  Signals help you decouple applications by sending "
"notifications when actions occur elsewhere in the core framework or "
"another Flask extensions.  In short, signals allow certain senders to "
"notify subscribers that something happened."
msgstr ""

#: ../../signals.rst:15
msgid ""
"Flask comes with a couple of signals and other extensions might provide "
"more.  Also keep in mind that signals are intended to notify subscribers "
"and should not encourage subscribers to modify data.  You will notice "
"that there are signals that appear to do the same thing like some of the "
"builtin decorators do (eg: :data:`~flask.request_started` is very similar"
" to :meth:`~flask.Flask.before_request`).  However, there are differences"
" in how they work.  The core :meth:`~flask.Flask.before_request` handler,"
" for example, is executed in a specific order and is able to abort the "
"request early by returning a response.  In contrast all signal handlers "
"are executed in undefined order and do not modify any data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../signals.rst:26
msgid ""
"The big advantage of signals over handlers is that you can safely "
"subscribe to them for just a split second.  These temporary subscriptions"
" are helpful for unit testing for example.  Say you want to know what "
"templates were rendered as part of a request: signals allow you to do "
"exactly that."

#: ../../signals.rst:35
msgid ""
"To subscribe to a signal, you can use the "
":meth:`~blinker.base.Signal.connect` method of a signal.  The first "
"argument is the function that should be called when the signal is "
"emitted, the optional second argument specifies a sender.  To unsubscribe"
" from a signal, you can use the :meth:`~blinker.base.Signal.disconnect` "
"method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../signals.rst:41
msgid ""
"For all core Flask signals, the sender is the application that issued the"
" signal.  When you subscribe to a signal, be sure to also provide a "
"sender unless you really want to listen for signals from all "
"applications.  This is especially true if you are developing an "
"extension."

"For example, here is a helper context manager that can be used in a unit "
"test to determine which templates were rendered and what variables were "
"passed to the template::"

msgid "This can now easily be paired with a test client::"

"Make sure to subscribe with an extra ``**extra`` argument so that your "
"calls don't fail if Flask introduces new arguments to the signals."

"All the template rendering in the code issued by the application `app` in"
" the body of the ``with`` block will now be recorded in the `templates` "
"variable.  Whenever a template is rendered, the template object as well "
"as context are appended to it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../signals.rst:82
msgid ""
"Additionally there is a convenient helper method "
"(:meth:`~blinker.base.Signal.connected_to`)  that allows you to "
"temporarily subscribe a function to a signal with a context manager on "
"its own.  Because the return value of the context manager cannot be "
"specified that way, you have to pass the list in as an argument::"

"If you want to use signals in your own application, you can use the "

"a custom :class:`~blinker.base.Namespace`..  This is what is recommended "
"most of the time::"

"signal subscribers::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../signals.rst:148

"Try to always pick a good sender.  If you have a class that is emitting a"
" signal, pass ``self`` as sender.  If you are emitting a signal from a "
