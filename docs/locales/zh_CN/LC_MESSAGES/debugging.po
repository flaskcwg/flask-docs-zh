"External debuggers, such as those provided by IDEs, can offer a more "

"Disabling these isn't required, an external debugger will continue to "

"disabled, it will catch unhandled exceptions before the external debugger"
" can. If the reloader is not disabled, it could cause an unexpected "
"reload if code changes during debugging."
