"Flask 0.7 introduces pluggable views inspired by the generic views from "
"Django which are based on classes instead of functions.  The main "
"intention is that you can replace parts of the implementations and this "
"way have customizable pluggable views."

"Consider you have a function that loads a list of objects from the "
"database and renders into a template::"

"This is simple and flexible, but if you want to provide this view in a "
"generic fashion that can be adapted to other models and templates as well"
" you might want more flexibility.  This is where pluggable class-based "
"views come into place.  As the first step to convert this into a class "
"based view you would do this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:39
msgid ""
"As you can see what you have to do is to create a subclass of "
":class:`flask.views.View` and implement "
":meth:`~flask.views.View.dispatch_request`.  Then we have to convert that"
" class into an actual view function by using the "
":meth:`~flask.views.View.as_view` class method.  The string you pass to "
"that function is the name of the endpoint that view will then have.  But "
"this by itself is not helpful, so let's refactor the code a bit::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:70
msgid ""
"This of course is not that helpful for such a small example, but it's "
"good enough to explain the basic principle.  When you have a class-based "
"view the question comes up what ``self`` points to.  The way this works "
"is that whenever the request is dispatched a new instance of the class is"
" created and the :meth:`~flask.views.View.dispatch_request` method is "
"called with the parameters from the URL rule.  The class itself is "
"instantiated with the parameters passed to the "
":meth:`~flask.views.View.as_view` function. For instance you can write a "
"class like this::"

"Pluggable views are attached to the application like a regular function "
"by either using :func:`~flask.Flask.route` or better "
":meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule`.  That however also means that you "
"would have to provide the names of the HTTP methods the view supports "
"when you attach this.  In order to move that information to the class you"
" can provide a :attr:`~flask.views.View.methods` attribute that has this "
"information::"

msgid ""
"For RESTful APIs it's especially helpful to execute a different function "
"for each HTTP method.  With the :class:`flask.views.MethodView` you can "
"easily do that.  Each HTTP method maps to a method of the class with the "
"same name (just in lowercase)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../views.rst:133

"That way you also don't have to provide the "
":attr:`~flask.views.View.methods` attribute.  It's automatically set "

"Since the view class itself is not the view function that is added to the"

":meth:`~flask.views.View.as_view` by hand::"

"Starting with Flask 0.8 there is also an alternative way where you can "
"specify a list of decorators to apply in the class declaration::"

"regular view decorators on the individual methods of the view however, "

"Web APIs are often working very closely with HTTP verbs so it makes a lot"

":class:`~flask.views.MethodView`.  That said, you will notice that the "
"API will require different URL rules that go to the same method view most"
" of the time.  For instance consider that you are exposing a user object "
