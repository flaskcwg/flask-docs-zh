"Ah yes, the good old problem of file uploads.  The basic idea of file "
"uploads is actually quite simple.  It basically works like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:7
msgid ""
"A ``<form>`` tag is marked with ``enctype=multipart/form-data`` and an "
"``<input type=file>`` is placed in that form."

"The application accesses the file from the :attr:`~flask.request.files` "
"dictionary on the request object."

"use the :meth:`~werkzeug.datastructures.FileStorage.save` method of the "
"file to save the file permanently somewhere on the filesystem."

"Let's start with a very basic application that uploads a file to a "
"specific upload folder and displays a file to the user.  Let's look at "
"the bootstrapping code for our application::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:31
msgid ""
"So first we need a couple of imports.  Most should be straightforward, "
"the :func:`werkzeug.secure_filename` is explained a little bit later.  "
"The ``UPLOAD_FOLDER`` is where we will store the uploaded files and the "
"``ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`` is the set of allowed file extensions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:36
msgid ""
"Why do we limit the extensions that are allowed?  You probably don't want"
" your users to be able to upload everything there if the server is "
"directly sending out the data to the client.  That way you can make sure "
"that users are not able to upload HTML files that would cause XSS "
"problems (see :ref:`security-xss`).  Also make sure to disallow ``.php`` "
"files if the server executes them, but who has PHP installed on their "
"server, right?  :)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:43
msgid ""
"Next the functions that check if an extension is valid and that uploads "
"the file and redirects the user to the URL for the uploaded file::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:77
msgid ""
"So what does that :func:`~werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` function "
"actually do? Now the problem is that there is that principle called "
"\"never trust user input\".  This is also true for the filename of an "
"uploaded file.  All submitted form data can be forged, and filenames can "
"be dangerous.  For the moment just remember: always use that function to "
"secure a filename before storing it directly on the filesystem."

msgid ""
"So you're interested in what that :func:`~werkzeug.utils.secure_filename`"
" function does and what the problem is if you're not using it?  So just "
"imagine someone would send the following information as `filename` to "
"your application::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:93
msgid ""
"Assuming the number of ``../`` is correct and you would join this with "
"the ``UPLOAD_FOLDER`` the user might have the ability to modify a file on"
" the server's filesystem he or she should not modify.  This does require "
"some knowledge about how the application looks like, but trust me, "
"hackers are patient :)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:99
msgid "Now let's look how that function works:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:104
msgid ""
"We want to be able to serve the uploaded files so they can be downloaded "
"by users. We'll define a ``download_file`` view to serve files in the "
"upload folder by name. ``url_for(\"download_file\", name=name)`` "
"generates download URLs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:117
msgid ""
"If you're using middleware or the HTTP server to serve files, you can "
"register the ``download_file`` endpoint as ``build_only`` so ``url_for`` "
"will work without a view function."

msgid "Improving Uploads"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:133
msgid ""
"So how exactly does Flask handle uploads?  Well it will store them in the"
" webserver's memory if the files are reasonably small, otherwise in a "
"temporary location (as returned by :func:`tempfile.gettempdir`).  But how"
" do you specify the maximum file size after which an upload is aborted?  "
"By default Flask will happily accept file uploads with an unlimited "
"amount of memory, but you can limit that by setting the "
"``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` config key::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:146
msgid ""
"The code above will limit the maximum allowed payload to 16 megabytes. If"
" a larger file is transmitted, Flask will raise a "
":exc:`~werkzeug.exceptions.RequestEntityTooLarge` exception."

msgid "Connection Reset Issue"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:152
msgid ""
"When using the local development server, you may get a connection reset "
"error instead of a 413 response. You will get the correct status response"
" when running the app with a production WSGI server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:156
msgid ""
"This feature was added in Flask 0.6 but can be achieved in older versions"
" as well by subclassing the request object.  For more information on that"
" consult the Werkzeug documentation on file handling."

msgid "Upload Progress Bars"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:164
msgid ""
"A while ago many developers had the idea to read the incoming file in "
"small chunks and store the upload progress in the database to be able to "
"poll the progress with JavaScript from the client. The client asks the "
"server every 5 seconds how much it has transmitted, but this is something"
" it should already know."

msgid "An Easier Solution"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fileuploads.rst:173
msgid ""
"Now there are better solutions that work faster and are more reliable. "
"There are JavaScript libraries like jQuery_ that have form plugins to "
"ease the construction of progress bar."

"Because the common pattern for file uploads exists almost unchanged in "
"all applications dealing with uploads, there are also some Flask "
"extensions that implement a full fledged upload mechanism that allows "
