"In Flask you can easily implement the opening of database connections on "
"demand and closing them when the context dies (usually at the end of the "
"request)."

"Now, to use the database, the application must either have an active "
"application context (which is always true if there is a request in "
"flight) or create an application context itself.  At that point the "
"``get_db`` function can be used to get the current database connection.  "
"Whenever the context is destroyed the database connection will be "
"terminated."

"Note: if you use Flask 0.9 or older you need to use "
"``flask._app_ctx_stack.top`` instead of ``g`` as the :data:`flask.g` "
"object was bound to the request and not application context."

"Please keep in mind that the teardown request and appcontext functions "
"are always executed, even if a before-request handler failed or was never"
" executed.  Because of this we have to make sure here that the database "
"is there before we close it."

"The upside of this approach (connecting on first use) is that this will "
"only open the connection if truly necessary.  If you want to use this "
"code outside a request context you can use it in a Python shell by "
"opening the application context by hand::"

"Now in each request handling function you can access `get_db()` to get "
"the current open database connection.  To simplify working with SQLite, a"
" row factory function is useful.  It is executed for every result "
"returned from the database to convert the result.  For instance, in order"
" to get dictionaries instead of tuples, this could be inserted into the "
"``get_db`` function we created above::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/sqlite3.rst:80
msgid ""
"This will make the sqlite3 module return dicts for this database "
"connection, which are much nicer to deal with. Even more simply, we could"
" place this in ``get_db`` instead::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/sqlite3.rst:84
msgid ""
"This would use Row objects rather than dicts to return the results of "
"queries. These are ``namedtuple`` s, so we can access them either by "
"index or by key. For example, assuming we have a ``sqlite3.Row`` called "
"``r`` for the rows ``id``, ``FirstName``, ``LastName``, and "
"``MiddleInitial``::"

"Additionally, it is a good idea to provide a query function that combines"
" getting the cursor, executing and fetching the results::"

"This handy little function, in combination with a row factory, makes "

"To pass variable parts to the SQL statement, use a question mark in the "
