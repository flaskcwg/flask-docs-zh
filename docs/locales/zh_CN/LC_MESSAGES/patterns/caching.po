"When your application runs slow, throw some caches in.  Well, at least "
"it's the easiest way to speed up things.  What does a cache do?  Say you "
"have a function that takes some time to complete but the results would "
"still be good enough if they were 5 minutes old.  So then the idea is "
"that you actually put the result of that calculation into a cache for "
"some time."

"Flask itself does not provide caching for you, but `Flask-Caching`_, an "
"extension for Flask does. Flask-Caching supports various backends, and it"
" is even possible to develop your own caching backend."
