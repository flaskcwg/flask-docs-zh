"When your application runs slow, throw some caches in.  Well, at least "
"it's the easiest way to speed up things.  What does a cache do?  Say you "
"have a function that takes some time to complete but the results would "
"still be good enough if they were 5 minutes old.  So then the idea is "
"that you actually put the result of that calculation into a cache for "
"some time."

"当你的应用运行缓慢，抛出里面的一些缓存。好吧，至少这是最简单的提速方法。"
"究竟缓存是做什么？假设你有一个需要消耗一些时间来完成工作的函数，但在5分钟"
"内完成，结果依然足够好。那么，这个想法是把计算的结果放到缓存里保留一段时"

"Flask itself does not provide caching for you, but `Flask-Caching <https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, an "
"extension for Flask does. Flask-Caching supports various backends, and "
"it is even possible to develop your own caching backend.
