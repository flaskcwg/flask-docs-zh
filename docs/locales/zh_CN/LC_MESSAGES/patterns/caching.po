"When your application runs slow, throw some caches in.  Well, at least "
"it's the easiest way to speed up things.  What does a cache do?  Say you "
"have a function that takes some time to complete but the results would "
"still be good enough if they were 5 minutes old.  So then the idea is "
"that you actually put the result of that calculation into a cache for "
"some time."

"当你的应用运行缓慢，把应用扔进缓存里面去。至少这是最简单的提速方法。究竟缓存做"
"了些什么？假设你有一个耗时的函数，5分钟后才能计算出结果。那么，其中一个想法"
"是把这个结果保留在缓存里一段时间。"

"Flask itself does not provide caching for you, but `Flask-Caching`_, an "
"extension for Flask does. Flask-Caching supports various backends, and it"
" is even possible to develop your own caching backend."

"Flask 自身对你不提供缓存，但 `Flask-Caching <https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`，"
"一个 Flask 的扩展可以做到。Flask-Caching 支持多种后端，同时甚至可以开发你自己的缓存后端。"
