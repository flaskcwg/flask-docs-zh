"When your application runs slow, throw some caches in.  Well, at least "
"it's the easiest way to speed up things.  What does a cache do?  Say you "
"have a function that takes some time to complete but the results would "
"still be good enough if they were 5 minutes old.  So then the idea is "
"that you actually put the result of that calculation into a cache for "
"some time."

"什么作用？假设你有一个函数需要花费一些时间完成执行，而它的计算结果在 5 分"
"钟后仍能使用。那么，你就可以把这个计算结果保留在缓存里一段时间。"

"it is even possible to develop your own caching backend."

"Flask 自身不提供缓存支持，但你可以使用一个叫做 `Flask-Caching`_ 的 Flask "
"扩展。Flask-Caching 支持多种后端，而且你甚至可以开发自己的缓存后端。"
