"Python has a really interesting feature called function decorators.  This "
"allows some really neat things for web applications.  Because each view in"
" Flask is a function, decorators can be used to inject additional "
"functionality to one or more functions.  The :meth:`~flask.Flask.route` "
"decorator is the one you probably used already.  But there are use cases "
"for implementing your own decorator.  For instance, imagine you have a "
"view that should only be used by people that are logged in.  If a user "
"goes to the site and is not logged in, they should be redirected to the "
"login page.  This is a good example of a use case where a decorator is an "
"excellent solution."

"So let's implement such a decorator.  A decorator is a function that wraps"
" and replaces another function.  Since the original function is replaced, "
"you need to remember to copy the original function's information to the "
"new function.  Use :func:`functools.wraps` to handle this for you."

"This example assumes that the login page is called ``'login'`` and that "

"To use the decorator, apply it as innermost decorator to a view function. "

"The ``next`` value will exist in ``request.args`` after a ``GET`` request "
"for the login page.  You'll have to pass it along when sending the "
"``POST`` request from the login form.  You can do this with a hidden input"
" tag, then retrieve it from ``request.form`` when logging the user in. ::"

"Imagine you have a view function that does an expensive calculation and "

"Here is an example cache function.  It generates the cache key from a "
"specific prefix (actually a format string) and the current path of the "
"request.  Notice that we are using a function that first creates the "
"decorator that then decorates the function.  Sounds awful? Unfortunately "
"it is a little bit more complex, but the code should still be "
"straightforward to read."

"A common pattern invented by the TurboGears guys a while back is a "

"three examples do exactly the same::"

"As you can see, if no template name is provided it will use the endpoint "
"of the URL map with dots converted to slashes + ``'.html'``.  Otherwise "
"the provided template name is used.  When the decorated function returns, "
"the dictionary returned is passed to the template rendering function.  If "
"``None`` is returned, an empty dictionary is assumed, if something else "
"than a dictionary is returned we return it from the function unchanged.  "
"That way you can still use the redirect function or return simple strings."
