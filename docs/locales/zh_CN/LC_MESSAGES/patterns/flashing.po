"Good applications and user interfaces are all about feedback.  If the "
"user does not get enough feedback they will probably end up hating the "
"application.  Flask provides a really simple way to give feedback to a "
"user with the flashing system.  The flashing system basically makes it "
"possible to record a message at the end of a request and access it next "
"request and only next request.  This is usually combined with a layout "
"template that does this. Note that browsers and sometimes web servers "
"enforce a limit on cookie sizes. This means that flashing messages that "
"are too large for session cookies causes message flashing to fail "
"silently."
