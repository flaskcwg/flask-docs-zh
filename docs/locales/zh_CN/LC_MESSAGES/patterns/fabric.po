"`Fabric`_ is a tool for Python similar to Makefiles but with the ability "
"to execute commands on a remote server.  In combination with a properly "
"set up Python package (:doc:`packages`) and a good concept for "
"configurations (:doc:`/config`) it is very easy to deploy Flask "
"applications to external servers."

"Fabric 1.0 has to be installed locally.  This tutorial assumes the latest"

"In the following example we are using `mod_wsgi` for the remote servers."
"  You can of course use your own favourite server there, but for this "
"example we chose Apache + `mod_wsgi` because it's very easy to setup and "
"has a simple way to reload applications without root access."

"A fabfile is what controls what Fabric executes.  It is named "
":file:`fabfile.py` and executed by the `fab` command.  All the functions "
"defined in that file will show up as `fab` subcommands.  They are "
"executed on one or more hosts.  These hosts can be defined either in the "
"fabfile or on the command line.  In this case we will add them to the "
"fabfile."

"Now how do you execute that fabfile?  You use the `fab` command.  To "
"deploy the current version of the code on the remote server you would use"
" this command::"

msgid ""
"However this requires that our server already has the "
":file:`/var/www/yourapplication` folder created and "
":file:`/var/www/yourapplication/env` to be a virtual environment.  "
"Furthermore are we not creating the configuration or ``.wsgi`` file on "
"the server.  So how do we bootstrap a new server into our infrastructure?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fabric.rst:79
msgid ""
"This now depends on the number of servers we want to set up.  If we just "
"have one application server (which the majority of applications will "
"have), creating a command in the fabfile for this is overkill.  But "
"obviously you can do that.  In that case you would probably call it "
"`setup` or `bootstrap` and then pass the servername explicitly on the "
"command line::"

"The WSGI file has to import the application and also to set an "

msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/fabric.rst:118
msgid ""
"The application itself then has to initialize itself like this to look "

"Now as mentioned above, the application will find the correct "
"configuration file by looking up the ``YOURAPPLICATION_CONFIG`` "

"where the application will able to find it.  Configuration files have the"
" unfriendly quality of being different on all computers, so you do not "
"version them usually."

#: ../../patterns/fabric.rst:138

"A popular approach is to store configuration files for different servers "

msgid ""
"Fabric will now connect to all servers and run the commands as written "
"down in the fabfile.  First it will execute pack so that we have our "
