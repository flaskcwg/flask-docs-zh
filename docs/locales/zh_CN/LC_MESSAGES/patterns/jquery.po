"`jQuery`_ is a small JavaScript library commonly used to simplify working"
" with the DOM and JavaScript in general.  It is the perfect tool to make "
"web applications more dynamic by exchanging JSON between server and "
"client."

"JSON itself is a very lightweight transport format, very similar to how "
"Python primitives (numbers, strings, dicts and lists) look like which is "
"widely supported and very easy to parse.  It became popular a few years "
"ago and quickly replaced XML as transport format in web applications."

#: ../../patterns/jquery.rst:19
msgid ""
"In order to use jQuery, you have to download it first and place it in the"
" static folder of your application and then ensure it's loaded.  Ideally "
"you have a layout template that is used for all pages where you just have"
" to add a script statement to the bottom of your ``<body>`` to load "
"jQuery:"

"Another method is using Google's `AJAX Libraries API "
"<https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/>`_ to load jQuery:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/jquery.rst:38
msgid ""
"In this case you have to put jQuery into your static folder as a "
"fallback, but it will first try to load it directly from Google. This has"
" the advantage that your website will probably load faster for users if "
"they went to at least one other website before using the same jQuery "
"version from Google because it will already be in the browser cache."

"Do you know where your application is?  If you are developing the answer "
"is quite simple: it's on localhost port something and directly on the "
"root of that server.  But what if you later decide to move your "
"application to a different location?  For example to "
"``http://example.com/myapp``?  On the server side this never was a "
"problem because we were using the handy :func:`~flask.url_for` function "
"that could answer that question for us, but if we are using jQuery we "
"should not hardcode the path to the application but make that dynamic, so"
" how can we do that?"

"A simple method would be to add a script tag to our page that sets a "
"global variable to the prefix to the root of the application.  Something "

"Now let's create a server side function that accepts two URL arguments of"
" numbers which should be added together and then sent back to the "
"application in a JSON object.  This is a really ridiculous example and is"
" something you usually would do on the client side alone, but a simple "
"example that shows how you would use jQuery and Flask nonetheless::"

"As you can see I also added an `index` method here that renders a "
"template.  This template will load jQuery as above and have a little form"
" where we can add two numbers and a link to trigger the function on the "
"server side."
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/jquery.rst:94
msgid ""
"Note that we are using the :meth:`~werkzeug.datastructures.MultiDict.get`"
" method here which will never fail.  If the key is missing a default "
"value (here ``0``) is returned.  Furthermore it can convert values to a "
"specific type (like in our case `int`).  This is especially handy for "
"code that is triggered by a script (APIs, JavaScript etc.) because you "
"don't need special error reporting in that case."

"Your index.html template either has to extend a :file:`layout.html` "
"template with jQuery loaded and the `$SCRIPT_ROOT` variable set, or do "
"that on the top. Here's the HTML code needed for our little application "
"(:file:`index.html`). Notice that we also drop the script directly into "
"the HTML here.  It is usually a better idea to have that in a separate "
"script file:"

"URL)."

#: ../../patterns/jquery.rst:141

"``$.getJSON(url, data, func)`` sends a ``GET`` request to `url` and will "
"send the contents of the `data` object as query parameters.  Once the "
"data arrived, it will call the given function with the return value as "
"argument.  Note that we can use the `$SCRIPT_ROOT` variable here that we "
"set earlier."
