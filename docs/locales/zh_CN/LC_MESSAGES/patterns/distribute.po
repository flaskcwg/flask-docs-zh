"`Setuptools`_, is an extension library that is commonly used to "
"distribute Python libraries and extensions. It extends distutils, a basic"

"**package registry**: setuptools registers your package with your Python "

" point\" that another package can hook into to extend the other package."

":file:`MANIFEST.in` file and install all the entries that match as "
"package data.  We will use this to distribute the static files and "
"templates along with the Python module (see :ref:`distributing-"
"resources`).  The ``zip_safe`` flag can be used to force or prevent zip "
"Archive creation.  In general you probably don't want your packages to be"
