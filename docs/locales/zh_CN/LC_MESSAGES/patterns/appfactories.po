"If you are already using packages and blueprints for your application "
"(:doc:`/blueprints`) there are a couple of really nice ways to further "
"improve the experience.  A common pattern is creating the application "
"object when the blueprint is imported.  But if you move the creation of "
"this object into a function, you can then create multiple instances of "
"this app later."

"Multiple instances.  Imagine you want to run different versions of the "
"same application.  Of course you could have multiple instances with "
"different configs set up in your webserver, but if you use factories, you"
" can have multiple instances of the same application running in the same "
"application process which can be handy."
