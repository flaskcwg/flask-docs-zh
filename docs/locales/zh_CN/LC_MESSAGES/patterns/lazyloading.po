"Flask is usually used with the decorators.  Decorators are simple and you "
"have the URL right next to the function that is called for that specific "
"URL.  However there is a downside to this approach: it means all your code"
" that uses decorators has to be imported upfront or Flask will never "
"actually find your function."

"This can be a problem if your application has to import quick.  It might "
"have to do that on systems like Google's App Engine or other systems.  So "
"if you suddenly notice that your application outgrows this approach you "
"can fall back to a centralized URL mapping."

"The system that enables having a central URL map is the "
":meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` function.  Instead of using decorators, "
"you have a file that sets up the application with all URLs."

"So far we only split up the views and the routing, but the module is still"
" loaded upfront.  The trick is to actually load the view function as "
"needed. This can be accomplished with a helper class that behaves just "
"like a function but internally imports the real function on first use::"

"What's important here is is that `__module__` and `__name__` are properly "
"set.  This is used by Flask internally to figure out how to name the URL "
"rules in case you don't provide a name for the rule yourself."

"You can further optimize this in terms of amount of keystrokes needed to "
"write this by having a function that calls into "
":meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` by prefixing a string with the project "
"name and a dot, and by wrapping `view_func` in a `LazyView` as needed.  ::"

"One thing to keep in mind is that before and after request handlers have "
"to be in a file that is imported upfront to work properly on the first "
"request.  The same goes for any kind of remaining decorator."
