"uWSGI is a deployment option on servers like `nginx`_, `lighttpd`_, and "
"`cherokee`_; see :doc:`fastcgi` and :doc:`wsgi-standalone` for other "
"options. To use your WSGI application with uWSGI protocol you will need a"
" uWSGI server first. uWSGI is both a protocol and an application server; "
"the application server can serve uWSGI, FastCGI, and HTTP protocols."
