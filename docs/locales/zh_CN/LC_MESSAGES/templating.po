msgid ""
"Autoescaping is the concept of automatically escaping special characters "
"for you.  Special characters in the sense of HTML (or XML, and thus XHTML)"
" are ``&``, ``>``, ``<``, ``\"`` as well as ``'``.  Because these "
"characters carry specific meanings in documents on their own you have to "
"replace them by so called \"entities\" if you want to use them for text.  "
"Not doing so would not only cause user frustration by the inability to use"
" these characters in text, but can also lead to security problems.  (see "
":ref:`security-xss`)"

#: ../../templating.rst:111

"Sometimes however you will need to disable autoescaping in templates. This"
" can be the case if you want to explicitly inject HTML into pages, for "
"example if they come from a system that generates secure HTML like a "
"markdown to HTML converter."

#: ../../templating.rst:118

"In the Python code, wrap the HTML string in a :class:`~flask.Markup` "
"object before passing it to the template.  This is in general the "
"recommended way."

"To inject new variables automatically into the context of a template, "
"context processors exist in Flask.  Context processors run before the "
"template is rendered and have the ability to inject new values into the "
"template context.  A context processor is a function that returns a "
"dictionary.  The keys and values of this dictionary are then merged with "
"the template context, for all templates in the app::"
