"Making your project installable means that you can build a *distribution* "
"file and install that in another environment, just like you installed "
"Flask in your project's environment. This makes deploying your project the"
" same as installing any other library, so you're using all the standard "
"Python tools to manage everything."

"``packages`` tells Python what package directories (and the Python files "
