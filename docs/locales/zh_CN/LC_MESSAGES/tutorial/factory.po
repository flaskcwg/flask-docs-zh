"A Flask application is an instance of the :class:`Flask` class. "

"The most straightforward way to create a Flask application is to create a"
" global :class:`Flask` instance directly at the top of your code, like "
"how the \"Hello, World!\" example did on the previous page. While this is"
" simple and useful in some cases, it can cause some tricky issues as the "
"project grows."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/factory.rst:16

"Instead of creating a :class:`Flask` instance globally, you will create "
"it inside a function. This function is known as the *application "
"factory*. Any configuration, registration, and other setup the "
"application needs will happen inside the function, then the application "
"will be returned."

"It's time to start coding! Create the ``flaskr`` directory and add the "
"``__init__.py`` file. The ``__init__.py`` serves double duty: it will "
"contain the application factory, and it tells Python that the ``flaskr`` "
"directory should be treated as a package."

"``create_app`` is the application factory function. You'll add to it "
"later in the tutorial, but it already does a lot."

"``app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)`` creates the "
":class:`Flask` instance."

"``__name__`` is the name of the current Python module. The app needs to "
"know where it's located to set up some paths, and ``__name__`` is a "
"convenient way to tell it that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/factory.rst:81
msgid ""
"``instance_relative_config=True`` tells the app that configuration files "
"are relative to the :ref:`instance folder <instance-folders>`. The "
"instance folder is located outside the ``flaskr`` package and can hold "
"local data that shouldn't be committed to version control, such as "
"configuration secrets and the database file."

msgid ""
":meth:`app.config.from_mapping() <Config.from_mapping>` sets some default"
" configuration that the app will use:"

":data:`SECRET_KEY` is used by Flask and extensions to keep data safe. "
"It's set to ``'dev'`` to provide a convenient value during development, "
"but it should be overridden with a random value when deploying."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/factory.rst:96
msgid ""
"``DATABASE`` is the path where the SQLite database file will be saved. "
"It's under :attr:`app.instance_path <Flask.instance_path>`, which is the "
"path that Flask has chosen for the instance folder. You'll learn more "
"about the database in the next section."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/factory.rst:102
msgid ""
":meth:`app.config.from_pyfile() <Config.from_pyfile>` overrides the "
"default configuration with values taken from the ``config.py`` file in "
"the instance folder if it exists. For example, when deploying, this can "
"be used to set a real ``SECRET_KEY``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/factory.rst:107
msgid ""
"``test_config`` can also be passed to the factory, and will be used "
"instead of the instance configuration. This is so the tests you'll write "
"later in the tutorial can be configured independently of any development "
"values you have configured."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/factory.rst:112
msgid ""
":func:`os.makedirs` ensures that :attr:`app.instance_path "
"<Flask.instance_path>` exists. Flask doesn't create the instance folder "
"automatically, but it needs to be created because your project will "
"create the SQLite database file there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/factory.rst:118
msgid ""
":meth:`@app.route() <Flask.route>` creates a simple route so you can see "
"the application working before getting into the rest of the tutorial. It "
"creates a connection between the URL ``/hello`` and a function that "
"returns a response, the string ``'Hello, World!'`` in this case."
