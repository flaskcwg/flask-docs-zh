"You've learned about quite a few Flask and Python concepts throughout the"
" tutorial. Go back and review the tutorial and compare your code with the"
" steps you took to get there. Compare your project to the :gh:`example "
"project <examples/tutorial>`, which might look a bit different due to the"

"There's a lot more to Flask than what you've seen so far. Even so, you're"
" now equipped to start developing your own web applications. Check out "
"the :doc:`/quickstart` for an overview of what Flask can do, then dive "
"into the docs to keep learning. Flask uses `Jinja`_, `Click`_, "
"`Werkzeug`_, and `ItsDangerous`_ behind the scenes, and they all have "
"their own documentation too. You'll also be interested in "
":doc:`/extensions` which make tasks like working with the database or "
"validating form data easier and more powerful."
