"SQLite is convenient because it doesn't require setting up a separate "
"database server and is built-in to Python. However, if concurrent requests"
" try to write to the database at the same time, they will slow down as "
"each write happens sequentially. Small applications won't notice this. "
"Once you become big, you may want to switch to a different database."

msgid ""
"The first thing to do when working with a SQLite database (and most other "
"Python database libraries) is to create a connection to it. Any queries "
"and operations are performed using the connection, which is closed after "
"the work is finished."

#: ../../tutorial/database.rst:32
msgid ""
"In web applications this connection is typically tied to the request. It "
"is created at some point when handling a request, and closed before the "
"response is sent."

":data:`g` is a special object that is unique for each request. It is used "
"to store data that might be accessed by multiple functions during the "
"request. The connection is stored and reused instead of creating a new "
"connection if ``get_db`` is called a second time in the same request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/database.rst:69
msgid ""
":data:`current_app` is another special object that points to the Flask "
"application handling the request. Since you used an application factory, "
"there is no application object when writing the rest of your code. "
"``get_db`` will be called when the application has been created and is "
"handling a request, so :data:`current_app` can be used."
