"You've written the authentication views for your application, but if "
"you're running the server and try to go to any of the URLs, you'll see a "
"``TemplateNotFound`` error. That's because the views are calling "
":func:`render_template`, but you haven't written the templates yet. The "
"template files will be stored in the ``templates`` directory inside the "
"``flaskr`` package."

"Templates are files that contain static data as well as placeholders for "
"dynamic data. A template is rendered with specific data to produce a "
"final document. Flask uses the `Jinja`_ template library to render "
"templates."

"In your application, you will use templates to render `HTML`_ which will "
"display in the user's browser. In Flask, Jinja is configured to "
"*autoescape* any data that is rendered in HTML templates. This means that"
" it's safe to render user input; any characters they've entered that "
"could mess with the HTML, such as ``<`` and ``>`` will be *escaped* with "
"*safe* values that look the same in the browser but don't cause unwanted "
"effects."

"Jinja looks and behaves mostly like Python. Special delimiters are used "
"to distinguish Jinja syntax from the static data in the template. "
"Anything between ``{{`` and ``}}`` is an expression that will be output "
"to the final document. ``{%`` and ``%}`` denotes a control flow statement"
" like ``if`` and ``for``. Unlike Python, blocks are denoted by start and "
"end tags rather than indentation since static text within a block could "
"change indentation."

":data:`g` is automatically available in templates. Based on if ``g.user``"
" is set (from ``load_logged_in_user``), either the username and a log out"
" link are displayed, or links to register and log in are displayed. "
":func:`url_for` is also automatically available, and is used to generate "
"URLs to views instead of writing them out manually."

"After the page title, and before the content, the template loops over "

"A useful pattern used here is to place ``{% block title %}`` inside ``{% "
