"In :doc:`/blueprints`, most error handlers will work as expected. "
"However, there is a caveat concerning handlers for 404 and 405 "

msgstr ""

#: ../../errorhandling.rst:401

"This is because the blueprint does not \"own\" a certain URL space, so "
"the application instance has no way of knowing which blueprint error "

"Using the same techniques as above and :func:`~flask.json.jsonify` we can"
