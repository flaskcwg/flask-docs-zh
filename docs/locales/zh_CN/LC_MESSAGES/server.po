"The ``flask run`` command line script is the recommended way to run the "

"Prior to Flask 1.0 the ``FLASK_ENV`` environment variable was not "

"When using the ``flask run`` command with the reloader, the server will "

"initialization errors into the code. Accessing the site will show the "
"interactive debugger for the error, rather than crashing the server. This"
" feature is called \"lazy loading\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../server.rst:132
msgid ""
"If a syntax error is already present when calling ``flask run``, it will "
"fail immediately and show the traceback rather than waiting until the "

"while still allowing the server to handle errors on reload."

"As an alternative to the ``flask run`` command, the development server "
"can also be started from Python with the :meth:`Flask.run` method. This "
"method takes arguments similar to the CLI options to control the server. "
"The main difference from the CLI command is that the server will crash if"
" there are errors when reloading."
