"Web applications usually face all kinds of security problems and it's "

"Cross site scripting is the concept of injecting arbitrary HTML (and with"
" it JavaScript) into the context of a website.  To remedy this, "
"developers have to properly escape text so that it cannot include "
"arbitrary HTML tags.  For more information on that have a look at the "
"Wikipedia article on `Cross-Site Scripting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki"
"/Cross-site_scripting>`_."

"Flask configures Jinja2 to automatically escape all values unless "
"explicitly told otherwise.  This should rule out all XSS problems caused "
"in templates, but there are still other places where you have to be "
"careful:"

"sending out textfiles from uploaded files.  Some browsers are using "
"content-type guessing based on the first few bytes so users could trick a"

"Another thing that is very important are unquoted attributes.  While "
"Jinja2 can protect you from XSS issues by escaping HTML, there is one "
"thing it cannot protect you from: XSS by attribute injection.  To counter"
" this possible attack vector, be sure to always quote your attributes "
"with either double or single quotes when using Jinja expressions in them:"
msgstr ""

"Why is this necessary?  Because if you would not be doing that, an "

"attacker could inject this piece of HTML+JavaScript:"

"When the user would then move with the mouse over the input, the cookie "
"would be presented to the user in an alert window.  But instead of "
"showing the cookie to the user, a good attacker might also execute any "
"other JavaScript code.  In combination with CSS injections the attacker "
"might even make the element fill out the entire page so that the user "
"would just have to have the mouse anywhere on the page to trigger the "
"attack."

"There is one class of XSS issues that Jinja's escaping does not protect "

"If your authentication information is stored in cookies, you have "

"Imagine you were to run Facebook with millions of concurrent users and "

"How can you prevent that?  Basically for each request that modifies "
"content on the server you would have to either use a one-time token and "
"store that in the cookie **and** also transmit it with the form data. "
"After receiving the data on the server again, you would then have to "
"compare the two tokens and ensure they are equal."
