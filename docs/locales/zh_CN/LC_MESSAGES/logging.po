"Flask uses standard Python :mod:`logging`. Messages about your Flask "
"application are logged with :meth:`app.logger <flask.Flask.logger>`, which"
" takes the same name as :attr:`app.name <flask.Flask.name>`. This logger "
"can also be used to log your own messages."

"If you don't configure logging, Python's default log level is usually "

"When you want to configure logging for your project, you should do it as "

"<flask.Flask.logger>` is accessed before logging is configured, it will "
"add a default handler. If possible, configure logging before creating the "
"application object."

"If you do not configure logging yourself, Flask will add a "

" automatically. During requests, it will write to the stream specified by "
"the WSGI server in ``environ['wsgi.errors']`` (which is usually "
