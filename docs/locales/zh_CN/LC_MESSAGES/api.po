msgid "Application Object"
msgstr ""

#: flask.app.Flask:1 of
msgid ""
"The flask object implements a WSGI application and acts as the central "
"object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the "
"application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for "
"the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more."
msgstr ""

#: flask.app.Flask:6 of
msgid ""
"The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the "
"package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the "
"package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with an "
":file:`__init__.py` file inside) or a standard module (just a ``.py`` "
"file)."

"Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or in "

msgid "About the First Parameter"
msgstr ""

#: flask.app.Flask:21 of
msgid ""
"The idea of the first parameter is to give Flask an idea of what belongs "
"to your application.  This name is used to find resources on the "
"filesystem, can be used by extensions to improve debugging information "
"and a lot more."
msgstr ""

#: flask.app.Flask:26 of
msgid ""
"So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single "
"module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are using"
" a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of your package"
" there."
msgstr ""

#: flask.app.Flask:31 of
msgid ""
"For example if your application is defined in "
":file:`yourapplication/app.py` you should create it with one of the two "
"versions below::"
msgstr ""

#: flask.app.Flask:37 of
msgid ""
"Why is that?  The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks to "
"how resources are looked up.  However it will make debugging more "
"painful.  Certain extensions can make assumptions based on the import "
"name of your application.  For example the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension "
"will look for the code in your application that triggered an SQL query in"
" debug mode.  If the import name is not properly set up, that debugging "
"information is lost.  (For example it would only pick up SQL queries in "
"`yourapplication.app` and not `yourapplication.views.frontend`)"
